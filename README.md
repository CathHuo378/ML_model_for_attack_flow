# ML_model_for_attack_flow
System developed for Advanced Topics in Computer Science

Date: 2023-06-03

Version: 1.1.1


## Purpose
This model is a tool that helps automate the construction of Attack Flow models. It is designed to map natural language documents into the corresponding techniques of the MITRE ATT&CK framework using a machine learning classifier. This tool is inspired by the package [CTI-to-MITRE with NLP](https://github.com/dessertlab/cti-to-mitre-with-nlp) but also includes the function of extracting involved assets in the attacks from the documents.

## Project Organisation
In the `attack_flows` directory you will find the 10 Attack Flow charts constructed for this project.

In the `example_docs` directory you will find an example resources chosen and employed in the document analysis process and an example result generated by the model.

## Minimum Requirements

## Supported OS
* Linux
* macOS

## Interpreter and tools
* Python 3

## Usage

### Running
```
$ python3 document_analysis.py {file_path}
```
