System developed for Advanced Topics in Computer Science

Date: 2023-06-03

Version: 1.1.1


## PURPOSE
This model is a tool that helps automate the construction of Attack Flow models. It is designed to map natural language documents into the corresponding techniques of the MITRE ATT&CK framework using a machine learning classifier. This tool is inspired by the package [CTI-to-MITRE with NLP](https://github.com/dessertlab/cti-to-mitre-with-nlp) but also includes the function of extracting involved assets in the attacks from the documents.
